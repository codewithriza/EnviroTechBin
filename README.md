# Project Details

> **Goal** :- To develop an advanced waste management system leveraging technology to monitor, sort, and transmit data from waste bins to a web server and to sort wet and dry waste .

### How to Make:

#### Hardware Components:
- Waste Bins
- Ultrasonic Sensors
- Servo Motor
- Microcontroller (Arduino and NodeMCU)
- Wet and Dry Waste Sorting Mechanism
- Wi-Fi Module
- Power Supply

#### Important Points:
- Sensor Placement
- Servo Calibration
- Data Transmission
- Sorting Mechanism
- Power Efficiency

### Working of the Project:

>The system operates by automatically opening its lid when a user approaches, employing an intelligent waste sorting mechanism to discern between wet and dry waste. Ultrasonic sensors continuously monitor fill levels and transmit real-time data to a web server via a NodeMCU-driven microcontroller through a Wi-Fi module. Municipal waste management authorities can efficiently plan collection routes, prioritize bins, and engage the community for responsible waste disposal and recycling.

### Advanced Features:

>The EnviroTechBin project combines automation, sensor technology, data analysis, and remote monitoring to simplify waste disposal, optimize collection routes, reduce costs, and promote sustainability, setting it apart from traditional waste bins.

### Total Cost:

₹1500
